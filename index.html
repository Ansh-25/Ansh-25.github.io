<h1>ALL ABOUT CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
<header>
<h3>WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING ?</h3>
<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services from applications to storage and processing power
typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, 
companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.One benefit of using cloud computing
services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead
simply pay for what they use, when they use it.In turn, providers of cloud computing services can benefit from significant economies
of scale by delivering the same services to a wide range of customers.</p>

<h4>History of cloud computing ?</h4>
<img src="https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AdobeStock_158880087-1024x440.jpeg" alt="history" width="600px">
<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE TERM</h3>
<p>The origin of the term is unclear. The word "cloud" is commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects that 
visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describe any set of things whose detais are not further inspected in a given context.</p>
<h3>1961</h3>
<p>At around in 1961, John MacCharty suggested in a speech at MIT that computing can be sold like a utility,
just like a water or electricity. It was a brilliant idea, but like all brilliant ideas, it was ahead if its time, 
as for the next few decades, despite interest in the model, the technology simply was not ready for it.</p>
<h3>1999</h3>
<p>In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering of applications to users using a simple website.
The applications were delivered to enterprises over the Internet, and this way the dream of computing sold as utility were true.</p>
<h3>2000s</h3>
<p>In 2002, Amazon started Amazon Web Services, providing services like storage, computation and even human intelligence. 
However, only starting with the launch of the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006 a truly commercial service open to everybody existed.
In 2009, Google Apps also started to provide cloud computing enterprise applications.Of course, all the big players are present 
in the cloud computing evolution, some were earlier,some were later. In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, and companies 
like Oracle and HP have all joined the game. This proves that today, cloud computing has become mainstream.</p>

<h2 align="center">COMMON CLOUD EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is an infrastructure and software model that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of storage, networks,
servers, and applications.It allows for data processing to be done a privately-owned cloud or a third-party server. This 
creates maximum speed and reliability. But the greatest benefitis its ease of installation, low maintenance, and scalability.
This way it grows with your needs.IaaS and SaaS cloud computing has skyrocketed since 2009 and now it’s all around us.
In fact, you’re probably reading this on the cloud right now. For some perspective on just how vital cloud storage and
 computing is to our daily lives</p>

<div class="examples">
<h3>Google Drive</h3>
<p>Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive 
allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files. In addition to a website, 
Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for Windows and macOS computers, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.
 Google Drive encompasses Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides, which are a part of the Google Docs office suite that
 permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited 
through the Google Docs suite are saved in Google Drive.</p>

<div class="examples">
<H3>Apple iCloud</h3>
<p>Apple's cloud storage product, iCloud, is designed to work seamlessly with all your Apple devices connected to the Internet. 
For example, you can upload photos from your iPhone and access them from your MacBook, upload music from your MacBook to listen
 to from your iPod Touch, or upload an important document from your Mac desktop to access from your iPad when you're on the go
But iCloud isn't Apple's first online storage service. MobileMe was iCloud's long-standing predecessor, offering synchronization
 services for an annual subscription fee. MobileMe's primary purpose was to keep certain files synchronized between multiple devices.
 This included e-mail, contacts, calendars, browser bookmarks, photo galleries and Apple iWeb and iDisk services. Though MobileMe
 was tailor-made for Apple products, it also gave users the option to synchronize data from non-Apple computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="examples">
<H3>Amazon cloud drive</h3>
<p>Amazon Cloud Drive is an online storage service that allows users to upload and access music, videos, documents and photos from
 Web-connected devices. The service also enables a user to stream music to a device, such as a computer, tablet PC or smartphone. 
Cloud Drive offers 5 GB of free storage and offers paid plans for 20 GB, 50 GB, 100 GB, 200 GB, 500 GB and 1 TB of Amazon cloud 
storage. Songs downloaded from the Amazon MP3 store are automatically added to the user’s Amazon Cloud Drive but do not count
 against the storage quota.</p>
